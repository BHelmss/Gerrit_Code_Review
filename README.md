# Gerrit_Code_Review

## Project Overview
Author: Brendan Helms

Date: November 24, 2024

Abstract: This project demonstrates the implementation of a Gerrit review workflow for secure software engineering. I created a new text file, staged and committed it using Git, pushed it to a Gerrit server, and facilitated a code review process with a new reviewer account. The workflow involved creating and managing branches, handling SSH authentication, reviewing changes, and merging updates, ensuring a collaborative and secure development process. The project highlights my ability to use Git and Gerrit for version control and code review in a team setting.

## Objectives
- Create, stage, and commit a new file using Git, ensuring proper version control practices.  

- Push changes to a Gerrit server, setting up a branch and resolving authentication issues.  

- Establish a code review process by creating a reviewer account and facilitating multi-user reviews.  

- Manage updates, merge changes, and create a commit point to finalize the review workflow.

## Project Steps and Findings
1. File Creation and Staging  
Created a new file text5.txt using the command echo "This is a text5 file for Gerrit review workflow" > text5.txt, verified with cat.  

2. Stage the file using git add text5.txt and confirmed with git status.

3. Committing and Pushing to Gerrit  
Committed the file with a message using git commit -m "Add text5.txt for review", verified with git status.  

4. Encountered an error when pushing to the Gerrit server due to a missing branch; resolved by creating branch1 on the server and fetching updates with git fetch gerritdemo.  

5. Disabled the Change-ID requirement in the repository settings to successfully push the commit.

6. Setting Up a Reviewer  
Attempted to create a new user via SSH on port 29418 but faced a permission error; resolved by generating an SSH key pair (id_rsa, id_rsa.pub) and adding the public key to the Gerrit server.  

7. Created a new Reviewer1 account using SSH, temporarily adding it to the Service Users group for visibility.

8. Code Review and Collaboration  
As admin, reviewed the text5.txt file, gave it a +1 rating, and assigned Reviewer1 for further review.  

9. Logged in as Reviewer1, reviewed the change, and gave a +1 rating, notifying the admin for final approval.

10. Final Changes and Approval  
As admin, edited text5.txt via the Gerrit interface, adding a second line to create Patchset2, then gave a +2 approval to finalize the change.  

11. Fetched Patchset2 to the local repository using git fetch gerritdemo refs/changes/04/12345/2 and merged it into branch1.  

12. Created an empty checkpoint commit to mark the completion of the review process.

## Key Takeaways
- Gained hands-on experience with Git commands (add, commit, push, fetch) and Gerrit for version control and code review.  

- Learned to troubleshoot SSH authentication issues by generating and configuring SSH keys for secure communication.  

- Demonstrated the ability to facilitate a collaborative code review process, ensuring secure and efficient software development workflows.

## Tools Used
- Git: Version control system used for staging, committing, and pushing changes.  

- Gerrit: Code review tool used to manage the review workflow and collaborate with reviewers.  

- SSH: Protocol used to authenticate and communicate with the Gerrit server.

## Conclusion
This project showcases my ability to implement a secure software engineering workflow using Git and Gerrit. By creating a file, pushing it to a Gerrit server, setting up a reviewer, and managing the review process, Iâ€™ve demonstrated proficiency in version control, collaboration, and secure development practices. These skills prepare me for roles in software engineering and cybersecurity where collaborative code review and secure workflows are essential.
